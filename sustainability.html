            <h3>Behaviour change is key</h3>
            <p>
              For almost a decade, our BehaviourWorks Australia team has been
              collaborating with leading government agencies and The Shannon
              Company to find people-centred solutions to social, environmental
              and organisational problems, but typically on a single issue and
              agency basis. In 2018-2019 we trialled a cross-agency approach,
              and turned our attention to Australia’s waste crisis. This brought
              several partners together in a collaborative project to assist
              households, businesses and the whole Australian community to
              avoid, reduce, reuse and recycle waste – and transition to a more
              circular economy.
            </p>
            <h3>Understanding the problem and how to improve it</h3>
            <p>
              The Waste and Circular Economy collaboration draws together the
              expertise, resources and reach of our partners including
              Sustainability Victoria, the Victorian Government Department of
              Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Environment Protection
              Authority Victoria, Australian Government Department of
              Agriculture, Water and the Environment and NSW Department of
              Planning, Industry and Environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              By working through elements of the BWA Method, which is a structured approach to solving problems through a behaviour change lens, we agreed to tackle three parts of the problem:
              <br />
              <br />
            <ul>
              <li>reducing contamination in kerbside commingled recycling </li>
              <li>
                establishing if consumer labelling could help improve circular economy outcomes, and
              </li>
              <li>
                helping businesses adopt circular economy practices.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            <p>
              We held a series of stakeholder interviews and rapid reviews to understand the challenges and ‘what’s worked’ across Australia and internationally. We then identified promising topics for trialling interventions in the next phase. The reviews also informed recent policy development in Victoria and NSW.
            </p>
            <h3>Trialling the solutions</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019-20, our team engaged further with an extended group of partners, including local councils and businesses, to gauge their interest in running a series of ground-breaking trials and experiments.  Four trials are now underway across the three projects, with preliminary results expected in August 2020.

            <h3>Charting pathways to implementation</h3>
            <p>
              Local communities are concerned about the future as change is
              occurring more rapidly than at any time in human history.
              Communities are asking how they can be more resilient, adaptive,
              cleaner, greener, manage risks, and cope with surprises. How can
              they achieve ambitious global sustainability goals, while
              responding to their own local needs and desires?
            </p>
            <p>
              MSDI is working with Deakin University to develop robust pathways
              for local Australian communities to adapt, prosper, and thrive
              under future uncertainty, taking a bottom up approach to achieving
              the SDGs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project has two parts to it:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Modelling and analysis to identify the pathways to achieve the
                SDGs in a local area (led by Deakin)
              </li>
              <li>
                Governance and participatory action to help realise those
                pathways, involving local stakeholders and bottom up initiatives
                (led by MSDI)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Building the tools and learning from the past</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019, the team at Deakin started to develop the architecture of
              a computational model that can simulate different pathways to
              achieving the SDGs, aligned with local needs and objectives.
              Meanwhile, our MSDI team reviewed local sustainability initiatives
              internationally. We wanted to understand the challenges faced and
              what creates success in bottom-up action. Those lessons will
              inform future action for the SDGs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, we also developed two comprehensive case studies in the
              Forrest-Otways community and the Goulburn-Murray community in
              Victoria. These communities are highly susceptible to the
              environmental, social and economic effects of climate change. They
              are also communities in transition who are working to define what
              a sustainable and resilient future looks like.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also held community workshops and consultation sessions to
              discuss the issues faced by these communities. They engaged with
              our researchers in co-creating detailed, locally-tailored
              objectives.

              In 2020 we’re continuing the modelling and governance work to
              develop practical information and strategies to be used by the
              communities in our case studies. Our ultimate aim is to build on
              those case studies to create a generic framework that local
              communities can use across rural and regional Australia. Use of
              this framework will ultimately help Australia and the world
              achieve the UN’s Agenda 2030 and the SDGs from a grass roots
              level.

            <h3>Towards SDG transformations</h3>
            <p>
              The Sustainable Development Goals are a blueprint to achieve a
              better and more sustainable future for all. They address the
              global challenges we face, including poverty, inequality, climate
              change, peace and justice. Global goals however require local
              action to be successful. That’s why three MSDI PhD students are
              taking a closer look at how this global framework can enable
              transformative change in different levels of society – from cities
              and urban spaces, to regional areas, and universities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our students are researching the ways in which people in different
              sectors are currently working with the SDGs. And they’re working
              to understand whether or not the SDGs are indeed leading to
              systemic change.
            </p>
            <h3>Understanding the past, engaging with the future</h3>
            <p>
              The program has enrolled three PhD students. Andrea Cuesta Claros’
              research is exploring the relationship between the SDGs and the
              transformative role of Higher Education Institutions towards
              sustainable development. Jarrod Grainger Brown’s research aims to
              understand the role the SDGs can play in changing the ways in
              which cities are planned and shaped. And Dianty Ningrum’s research
              is examining the scope for transformative local action in
              implementing the SDGs.
            </p>
            <p>
              They kicked off their research in September 2019 by trying to
              understand and synthesise the lessons from past experiences of
              engaging with sustainable development in cities, regional and
              local communities, and universities. They also looked at how
              transformations and transformative change are understood in these
              spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020, the students will publish the results of their reviews and
              start their case studies to understand how different societal
              stakeholders are currently working with the SDGs. They’ll also
              examine the enablers and barriers to transformative action.
              Ultimately, they will develop frameworks for governance through
              the SDGs, to support different stakeholders to become agents for
              change towards sustainable development.
