          <h3>Behaviour change is key</h3>
          <p>
            For almost a decade, our BehaviourWorks Australia team has been collaborating with leading government agencies and The Shannon Company to find human-centred solutions to social, environmental and organisational problems. In 2018-2019 we turned our attention to Australia’s waste crisis, bringing several partners together in a new ‘mission-based’ project to make it easier for households, businesses and the whole Australian community to avoid, reduce, reuse and recycle waste.
          </p>
          <h3>Identifying where we can help</h3>
          <p>
            The Waste and Circular Economy collaboration draws together the expertise, resources and reach of partners including Sustainability Victoria, the Victorian Government Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, Environment Protection Authority Victoria, Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment and NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            By working through several steps outlined in the BWA Method, the partners identified three areas to focus on:
            <br> 
              <ul>
                <li>Reducing kerbside and commingled recycling contamination</li>
                <li>Figuring out if consumer labelling could help improve circular economy outcomes, and
                <li>Overcoming barriers to businesses adopting circular economy practices.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Following a series of stakeholder interviews and rapid reviews to figure out ‘what’s worked’ in other areas and jurisdictions, we shared the findings with the partners and with national and international experts. The reviews also informed recent policy development in Victoria and NSW.
          </p>
          <h3>Trialling the solutions</h3>
          <p>
            In 2019, our team engaged further with an extended group of partners, including local councils and businesses, to gauge their interest in running a series of ground-breaking trials and experiments. Our aim is to apply behavioural public policy interventions to the three areas. Four trials are now underway across the three projects, with preliminary results expected in July 2020.

          <h3>Charting pathways to implementation</h3>
          <p>
            Local communities are concerned about the future as change is occurring more rapidly than at any time in human history. Communities are asking how they can be more resilient, adaptive, cleaner, greener, manage risks, and cope with surprises. How can they achieve ambitious global sustainability goals, while responding to their own local needs and desires? 
          </p>
          <p>
            MSDI is working with Deakin University to develop robust pathways for local Australian communities to adapt, prosper, and thrive under future uncertainty, taking a bottom up approach to achieving the SDGs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project has two parts to it:
              <ul>
                <li>Modelling and analysis to identify the pathways to achieve the SDGs in a local area (led by Deakin)</li>
                <li>Governance and participatory action to help realise those pathways, involving local stakeholders and bottom up initiatives (led by MSDI)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Building the tools and learning from the past   </h3>
          <p>
            In 2019, the team at Deakin started to develop the architecture of a computational model that can simulate different pathways to achieving the SDGs, aligned with local needs and objectives. Meanwhile, our MSDI team reviewed local sustainability initiatives internationally. We wanted to understand the challenges faced and what creates success in bottom-up action. Those lessons will inform future action for the SDGs. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, we also developed two comprehensive case studies in the Forrest-Otways community and the Goulburn-Murray community in Victoria. These communities are highly susceptible to the environmental, social and economic effects of climate change. They are also communities in transition who are working to define what a sustainable and resilient future looks like.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also held community workshops and consultation sessions to discuss the issues faced by these communities. They engaged with our researchers in co-creating detailed, locally-tailored objectives. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020 we’re continuing the modelling and governance work to develop practical information and strategies to be used by the communities in our case studies. Our ultimate aim is to build on those case studies to create a generic framework that local communities can use across rural and regional Australia. Use of this framework will ultimately help Australia and the world achieve the UN’s Agenda 2030 and the SDGs from a grass roots level.

          <h3>Towards SDG transformations </h3>
          <p>
            The Sustainable Development Goals are a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, peace and justice. Global goals however require local action to be successful. That’s why three MSDI PhD students are taking a closer look at how this global framework can enable transformative change in different levels of society – from cities and urban spaces, to regional areas, and universities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our students are researching the ways in which people in different sectors are currently working with the SDGs. And they’re working to understand whether or not the SDGs are indeed leading to systemic change.
          </p>
          <h3>Understanding the past, engaging with the future </h3>
          <p>
            The program has enrolled three PhD students. Andrea Cuesta Claros’ research is exploring the relationship between the SDGs and the transformative role of Higher Education Institutions towards sustainable development. Jarrod Grainger Brown’s research aims to understand the role the SDGs can play in changing the ways in which cities are planned and shaped. And Dianty Ningrum’s research is examining the scope for transformative local action in implementing the SDGs.
          </p>
          <p>
            They kicked off their research in September 2019 by trying to understand and synthesise the lessons from past experiences of engaging with sustainable development in cities, regional and local communities, and universities. They also looked at how transformations and transformative change are understood in these spaces. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, the students will publish the results of their review and start their case studies to understand how different societal stakeholders are currently working with the SDGs. They’ll also examine the enablers and barriers to transformative action. Ultimately, they will develop frameworks for governance through the SDGs, to support different stakeholders to become agents for change towards sustainable development.
