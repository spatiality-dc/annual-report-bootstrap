          <h3>RISE: Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments</h3>
          <p>
            More than a billion people live in informal settlements around the world, with population growth and globalisation likely to attract another two billion people to the urban fringes by 2050.  The health and wellbeing of these residents is directly linked to the health of the environment and associated exposures to pathogens, pollutants and disease vectors in water, food, air and soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional approaches for providing water and sanitation – the ‘big pipes’ that capture, treat and dispose of water and human waste, and household-scale interventions that shift responsibility to resource-poor households – can take decades to reach informal settlements. They are not fit-for-purpose in high-density urban slums.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these problems, and with funding from the Wellcome Trust and the Asian Development Bank, our RISE (Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments) initiative is testing a localised, water-sensitive approach to improve the lives of 7,000 people living in 26 informal settlements in Fiji and Indonesia.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are implementing the first-ever scientific evidence examining if a localised, water-sensitive approach can improve both the environment and people’s health in informal settlements.
          </p>
          <h3>Building global momentum</h3>
          <p>
            2019 was a year of building global momentum. We welcomed three new partners to the fold: the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and UN-Habitat. They will help RISE develop infrastructure, generate evidence and progress the SDGs in the Asia-Pacific. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With the Fijian and Indonesian Governments, local communities and a global research network, in 2019 we continued analysing data from 24 settlements, gaining a clearer picture of the health of residents and the environment, and establishing a baseline from which to measure the effectiveness of our interventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            A demonstration project in Makassar, showcasing how RISE’s water-sensitive technologies function, was completed and launched by the Mayor of Makassar and President of the Asian Development Bank. Construction of a similar project has commenced in Suva. The team also held a series of intensive and inclusive participatory design workshops in Makassar to plan infrastructure for the first six formal settlements to be upgraded.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a growing list of local and international partners, RISE continues to develop and deliver pioneering research findings, which enrich the case for the need for sustainable, cost-effective infrastructure solutions to be expanded across the region and globally.

          <h3>Solving a 'wicked problem'</h3>
          <p>
            Spanning almost 300 km, the Citarum River in West Java, Indonesia, provides water and electricity for over 25 million people. For decades, tens of thousands of tons of solid waste and wastewater, predominantly from households and industry, have poured into the river every day, earning the Citarum the unfortunate title of being one of the world’s most polluted rivers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018, President Joko Widodo mandated action through a Presidential Decree, and a taskforce was set up to undertake preventative and remedial measures. However, with domestic and industrial waste still flowing into the river, restoring the ecology remains a ‘wicked problem’; one that requires multinational, transdisciplinary approaches and partnerships between government, industry and communities.
          </p>
          <h3>A transdisciplinary approach</h3>
          <p>
            In 2019, Monash and Universitas Indonesia (UI) were invited to join in the efforts to revitalise the river and its vulnerable communities. In a project led by Monash Art, Design and Architecture (MADA), MSDI researchers from our BehaviourWorks and Water teams joined MADA and UI to participate in a workshop hosted by the Provincial Environmental Agency and the Citarum Taskforce.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group reported on the progress of our innovative Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments program, and led discussions on how a RISE-style approach could provide a roadmap for long-term transitions for the Citarum River.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group also visited several key clean-up sites and met with local communities and researchers from Institut Teknologi Bandung, Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, and Padjadjaran University to build relationships and seed a learning network. Together with UI and the Citarum Taskforce, we're now working to unpack and address the complex socio-technical challenges facing the river and its communities.

          <h3>Bringing people together</h3>
          <p>
            Australian water utilities have a long history of driving innovation and contributing to the social, environmental and economic wellbeing of our country. However, climate uncertainty, population growth and urban development are presenting new challenges the sector can only address if it collaborates with stakeholders and communities across multiple sectors and regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SDGs serve as a rich enabling tool for mobilising efforts and guiding the transformations needed to achieve long-term sustainability outcomes for communities and the environment. MSDI's water experts are helping to bring these themes, stakeholders and activities together in a meaningful, actionable, way.
          </p>
          <h3>A blueprint for a sustainable future</h3>
          <p>
            Working with the Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA) and Australian water utilities more generally, we're helping to develop a new SDG reporting framework to operationalise sustainable development through utility-specific targets and indicators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deep industry engagement in 2019 found that water utilities already contribute to over 69 targets across all 17 SDGs and identified over 140 bespoke indicators for measuring and progressing SDG contributions. This work is also building an understanding of what best practice Integrated Water Management (IWM) looks like in an Australian context.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The framework and associated guidelines we’re developing will:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Show how utilities already contribute to sustainable development and the SDGs.</li>
              <li>Support strategic planning, management and governance processes, which take a 'whole of water-cycle' approach and deliver greater value to communities and environment.</li>
              <li>Identify areas in which businesses can contribute to sustainable development outcomes and test practices and processes for achieving best practice IWM.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our SDG reporting framework and best practice guidelines will be promoted as a blueprint for helping the sector deliver optimised and integrated sustainable water management and services that benefit people and the planet.

          <h3>Increasing access to clean water</h3>
          <p>
            Tests of a new micro-desalination water purifier developed by the Monash Department of Chemical Engineering and MSDI's Oxfam-Monash Partnership suggest that it could be a 'game changer' in terms of bringing clean water to vulnerable and off-grid communities around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prototype, which received seed funding from the Monash Infrastructure Institute and Oxfam Australia, uses reverse osmosis technology to produce pure water from contaminated sources and it can function in locations where power supply is either costly, unreliable, or non-existent. The system has already jumped through several production phases and we’re now seeking to scale the project up as part of broader efforts by MSDI and Monash to address SDG6 challenges. 
          </p>
          <h3>Testing the prototype</h3>
          <p>
            In 2019, the team completed tests to ensure the system meets Oxfam's performance criteria in terms of minimum clean water production, low cost, maintenance and energy-use. The team also reviewed similar systems, finding theirs to be among the most affordable water purification technologies available.
          </p>
          <p>
            With additional funding from Perpetual Impact, we also developed three new models for further research under controlled conditions in the laboratory as well as under field-like conditions to test durability and quality performance. The Lord Mayor’s Charitable Foundation has also come on board to help launch the second phase of the project, involving co-creation workshops with Indigenous communities affected by high salinity and other water contamination issues. While the December bushfires in Australia put some of that work on hold, efforts are ramping up in 2020.

          <h3>Going beyond one-size-fits-all</h3>
          <p>
            Nearly 2.5 billion people, a third of the world's population, don't have access to good sanitation. And over 780 million people lack access to clean water, including some of the world's most vulnerable communities. Initiatives to improve access to water, sanitation and hygiene have been shown to improve health, life-expectancy, student learning, gender equality and reduce illness. 
          </p>
          <p>
            But those initiatives have also been criticised for being gender-blind: that is of ignoring gender sensitivities in favour of a one-size-fits-all approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            MSDI, in partnership with Emory University and Universitas Husanuddin, and supported by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Water for Women Fund, have begun research to improve this. Together we're looking at how we can better work with the world's most vulnerable and marginalised people in urban informal settlements to design water and sanitation services in a gender-responsive and socially inclusive way.
          </p>
          <h3>Creating the toolkit</h3>
          <p>
            Launched in August 2019, this study is part of Monash’s RISE program. In 2019, our researchers, along with our partners from Emory University, visited Makassar in Indonesia to meet with key stakeholders. This included the RISE Makassar team, and key government and civil society partners. The team also visited the RISE project sites and engaged with key gender researchers across Makassar.  
          </p>
          <p>
            A planning workshop was held with colleagues from Monash and Emory University in Melbourne to finalise the research design and the team also formalised its partnership with Universitas Husanuddin. We are now collecting data for the project and have begun creating a toolkit for gender-sensitive and socially inclusive co-design of water, sanitation and hygiene services in urban informal settlements.

          <h3>Filling in the gaps</h3>
          <p>
            Providing clean water and sanitation for all – SDG 6 – is a goal that Australia aspires to. It's also an area in which Australian water businesses can make a major contribution.  Ensuring that the sector has the capacity to provide water to regional and remote communities is important. But one-size-fits-all approaches may not provide the long-term solutions that regional and remote communities want or need. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018, a high-level review of Australia's progress on SDG 6 identified significant gaps in the collection of water data. That meant we had no way of knowing if the best water management decisions were being made or if community needs were being considered. MSDI's water experts are helping to fill this knowledge gap.
          </p>
          <h3>Developing fit-for-purpose solutions</h3>
          <p>
            A national working group chaired by MSDI Professor Rob Skinner and including a wide range of water sector representatives has been working to identify new data collection processes and to develop bespoke drinking water and sanitation indicators and reporting actions that leave no one behind.  
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, our team consulted closely with the Federal National Water Reform Commission to provide advice on the appropriateness and relevance of SDG 6 targets and methodologies for Australia. We worked to identify new measures to accurately report our progress against SDG 6 targets. And we developed methodologies that we will use to conduct a comprehensive review of indicators around the health of water-related ecosystems and the degree to which they’ve changed. This includes bespoke "leave no one behind" drinking water and sanitation indicators which help us better understand water and sanitation access for vulnerable and isolated communities in Australia. We're also working to establish a research program into the health of our water-related ecosystems in Australia.

          <h3>Developing frameworks for cross-sectoral collaborations</h3>
          <p>
            Access to good clean water is something we've come to expect, but population growth, drought, urban living and other factors mean that we need to think more innovatively about water services. Many of the innovative water solutions that can enhance the liveability and resilience of our cities are decentralised and place-based. That means they have to be integrated in urban spaces, rather than buried under the ground. Implementing these solutions requires better integration and collaboration between urban planners and water infrastructure planners.
          </p>
          <p>
            MSDI has been working with the CRC for Water Sensitive Cities for several years, and together with an expert team from Monash Art, Design and Architecture, we are developing a framework for integrating water infrastructure planning with urban planning to deliver more innovative water servicing solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            MSDI is leading research on collaborative governance; that is how to set up cross-sectoral collaborations between city planners, water authorities and government agencies.
          </p>
          <h3>Developing step-by-step guidance</h3>
          <p>
            In 2019, we conducted more than 30 interviews and ran several workshops with practitioners across Australia, to develop step-by-step guidance on how to set up cross-sectoral collaborations.   
          </p>
          <p>
            Two reports were produced in 2019: "Enabling water sensitive urban development: planning and governance options for Perth", and "Brabham [Western Australia] Action Learning Partnership: Case report". The team also tested some of the early outcomes of our research on a case study of urban development in Western Australia. We will further test our research findings in another case study in Victoria, in 2020. The project is due to be completed in December this year and will provide guidance on different aspects of integrated urban and water planning, including on cross-sectoral collaborations.
