                  early stages of his career, Paul was named Victoria’s Young
                  Water Professional of the Year for his substantial
                  contribution to the Australian water sector in just ten years.

                  tools and influence to foster a socially inclusive and
                  sustainable water future for everyone. In 2020, Paul was named
                  the Young Water Professional of the Year in the Australian
