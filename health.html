            <h3>Forming an Alliance</h3>
            <p>
              The lyrics, ‘We are one, but we are many’, from the popular song
              ‘I am Australian’ speaks to our ambition to be an inclusive
              society; one where all people, regardless of race, religion,
              sexual orientation, age, gender or disability can fully contribute
              and feel accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keeping the values of respect and fairness at the heart of
              Australian culture is the aim of
              <a href="https://www.inclusiveaustralia.com.au/" target="_blank"
                >Inclusive Australia (IA)</a
              >, a new alliance formed by concerned organisations and
              individuals around the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              To begin its work, IA needed data on where we’re doing well and
              where we’re falling down. That’s where we came in. IA asked our
              BehaviourWorks Australia team to conduct a foundational survey to
              provide a benchmark from which to monitor our progress towards an
              inclusive Australia.
            </p>
            <h3>Benchmarking our Progress</h3>
            <p>
              Since 2017, the team has surveyed more than 6,000 Australians for
              their views and experiences of discrimination. We asked how much
              contact participants had with people from minority groups and the
              nature of that contact, how they felt about belonging and
              wellbeing and how willing they were to volunteer or advocate on
              behalf of minorities. We also sought out minority groups to ask
              about their experiences of discrimination and prejudice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our results, published in Australia’s first-ever
              <a
                href="https://inclusive-australia.s3.amazonaws.com/files/Inclusive-Australia-Social-Inclusion-Index-WEB.pdf"
                target="_blank"
                >Social Inclusion Index</a
              >, suggest that while we are not a highly prejudiced nation, there
              is room for improvement. However, almost a quarter of Australians
              experienced a major form of discrimination such as being unfairly
              denied a job and 27 percent experienced some form of ‘everyday’
              discrimination, such as being called names. Critically, people who
              experienced discrimination had a lower sense of wellbeing and
              weaker identification with Australia than those who had not.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Index will now be updated annually, with work also commencing
              in 2019 on a unique Diversity and Inclusion Tool to help business
              managers reduce discrimination in the workplace.

            <h3>Understanding the impacts</h3>
            <p>
              Most people accept that climate change is transforming the global
              atmosphere and environment, but far fewer people understand the
              significant effects that climate change and environmental change
              are already having on human health. In our region alone, changing
              weather patterns, environmental degradation and natural disasters
              like bushfires, are causing more deaths, illnesses and injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, MSDI contributed to the landmark Global Health Alliance
              (GHA) report
              <a

                target="_blank"
                >From Townsville to Tuvalu</a
              >. The report, which received widespread media coverage, was
              produced in collaboration with the Monash School of Public Health
              and Preventive Medicine and GHA member organisations. It frames
              the urgent regional challenges in planetary health terms and
              offers a roadmap forward.
            </p>
            <h3>Recommendations for change</h3>
            <p>
              Using evidence and case studies, From Townsville to Tuvalu shows
              how, for example, increased air and industrial pollution is linked
              to pulmonary and cardiovascular disease and how floods are
              increasing the spread of disease.

              advanced discussions on the need for Australia to build bonds with
              the Asia-Pacific and how our aid, health and agricultural budgets
              can be used to build resilience. The authors made nine
              recommendations for Australian governments, including introducing
              a benchmark health survey, training health workforces and
              consulting deeply with health ministers in the Pacific before
              investing.

              The report was widely discussed in the media, with MSDI Chair,
              Professor John Thwaites, making several mainstream media
              appearances to talk about the urgency of the issue and the
              cross-sector interventions required.

            <h3>Recognising the warning signs</h3>
            <p>
              Financial abuse, also known as economic abuse, is a form of family
              violence. It happens when a partner, relative or carer
              intentionally uses finances as a weapon to control another person.
              A common tactic is debt abuse, where the victim is forced to take
              out a loan, or maintain repayments, and may have the asset
              withheld from them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking,
              Superannuation and Financial Services Industry did not examine
              financial abuse, but it did say that banks may be enabling abuse
              and that the sector was failing to adequately recognise the
              warning signs.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make progress on the issue, which affects up to 16 percent of
              women and seven percent of men, MSDI worked with specialists in
              the Monash faculties of Law and Arts to find insights the
              Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) could turn
              into action.
            </p>

                >Associate Professor of Law, Becky Batagol</a
              >, the review sought to ascertain current levels of knowledge and
              explore how various forms of financial abuse play out in the real
              world. The project, which involved a literature review and a
              review of a decade’s worth of court decisions, as well as
              stakeholder and expert consultations, explored the social and
              emotional impacts of financial abuse on victims and how survivors
              typically raise concerns with financial institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team delivered their report to ASIC in December. It sets out
              the options for making the sector ‘financial abuse aware’ and
              reducing the harm to consumers who have experienced financial
              abuse. The key mechanism proposed was the introduction of
              mandatory financial abuse policies for all lenders, mortgage
              brokers and debt collectors. The report recognises the crucial
              economic and social roles that financial services play in our
              lives and how they form part of our communal response to two of
              our most pressing social problems: family violence and elder
              abuse.

            <h3>Transforming Riyadh Sustainably</h3>
            <p>
              Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, has been attracting merchants
              and immigrants since the 14th Century. Over the past two decades,
              however, the city’s population has grown rapidly and is now
              expected to double from seven to 14 million by 2030.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city is located in the middle of the desert on the Arabian
              Peninsula and natural resources are limited, so the need for
              sustainable approaches to things like water and energy is acute.
              The kingdom also wants to diversify its economy away from oil and
              invest in major liveability initiatives so that Riyadh can remain
              a resilient global hub - and an inspiring place to live.
            </p>
            <h3>Evaluating the Plan</h3>
            <p>
              MSDI has been working with the city’s leaders since 2015, after
              the Arriyadh Development Authority (now the Royal Commission for
              Riyadh City) invited former MSDI Director,
              <a
                href="https://www.monash.edu/sustainable-development/about-us/our-people/profiles/david-griggs"
                target="_blank"
                >Professor David Griggs</a
              >, to evaluate the city’s environmental plan. Joining him was
              BehaviourWorks Director,
              <a
                href="https://www.monash.edu/sustainable-development/about-us/our-people/profiles/liam-smith"
                target="_blank"
                >Professor Liam Smith</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              The MSDI team reviewed 50 programs organised under five themes
              (air pollution, waste, water management, natural resources and
              open areas and wildlife), making 110 recommendations on how to
              improve, escalate or continue existing programs using behaviour
              change and other approaches. We also introduced a new climate
              change theme.
            </p>
            <h3>Reviewing the Results and a New Plan</h3>
            <p>
              In September 2019, our team returned to undertake a second review
              and see how our 2015 recommendations had been adopted and
              implemented. This time, we evaluated 311 sub-programs and made
              more recommendations for the next plan, including the introduction
              of a biodiversity theme.
            </p>
            <p>
              In November, we delivered our findings, and also assisted with the
              planning for and chairing of, the Riyadh Sustainable Future
              Symposium. Our team are now in discussion with city leaders about
              a range of possible future projects focusing on climate change and
              planning for the 2020 G20 Summit.

                        future?
                        <br /><br />
                        Our Transforming Cities for Sustainability unit will
                        introduce you to the key principles of Net Zero
                        emissions and Water Sensitive Cities, drawing on Monash
                        University’s leading international research and practice
                        and Monash as a ‘living lab’. It will also help you
                        rethink how urban climate, water and energy systems can
                        be optimised through urban planning to create
                        sustainable cities.

            <h3>Preventing harm</h3>
            <p>
              Victorians enjoy a world-class public health system with great
              facilities, highly-trained staff and a culture of compassion. But
              in any complex health system where numerous decisions are made
              under pressure, things can and do go wrong. The causes are many
              and varied, but human behaviour plays a part.
            </p>
            <p>
              To examine the potential of behaviour change to reduce preventable
              harm in healthcare, the Victorian Managed Insurance Authority
              (VMIA) – the state’s insurer of health and other government
              services – funded our BehaviourWorks Australia (BWA) team to
              collaborate with it and The Shannon Company on a three-year
              Research and Innovation Program.
            </p>
            <p>
              The research team worked with a range of stakeholders, including
              the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services, Safer Care
              Victoria and representatives of hospitals, emergency services and
              other groups to identify priority health challenges, which we’re
              seeking to address via seven simple, scalable behaviour change
              interventions.
            </p>
            <h3>The Patient Journey</h3>
            <p>
              The seven trials were conducted at various points along the
              patient journey where people intersect with the health system.
              Three of these trials were conducted in 2019 with the program set
              to conclude in early 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key findings include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Simulating difficult conversations with a trained actor improved
                the confidence of health service board members to tackle
                difficult issues in the boardroom,
              </li>
              <li>
                A ‘Rapid Diagnostic Discussion’ (RaDD) tool in Emergency
                Departments altered almost 25 percent of working diagnoses of
                abdominal pain, including serious problems initially thought to
                be minor ailments,
              </li>
              <li>
                Providing patients with a simple, co-designed notepad enabled
                them to engage more in their healthcare and notified staff of
                safety and care issues they otherwise would have missed, and
              </li>
              <li>
                A ‘choose your own adventure’ training video showed promise,
                with clinicians reporting less reluctance and more confidence to
                escalate care following training.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The program has involved some of Victoria’s largest hospitals and
              staff who were engaged to participate via a series of creative
              communication pieces. The learnings from this program will be
              shared with thousands of health workers and with MSDI teams
              working on other health projects.
