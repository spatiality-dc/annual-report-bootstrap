                <h3>Today’s Problems, Yesterday’s Toolkit</h3>
                <p>
                  This report, produced in partnership with the NYU Governance
                  Lab is an assessment of innovation in the Australian public
                  service. The report was co-authored by Gov Lab’s Professor
                  Beth Noveck and MSDI’s Professor Rod Glover. It was developed
                  for the Australia and New Zealand School of Government
                  (ANZSOG). It outlines the results of a world-first survey of
                  nearly 400 public servants and found that while Australia’s
                  public sector is generally well-functioning, it faces a
                  ‘creeping crisis’ of effectiveness and legitimacy. The authors
                  propose three areas of focus moving forward: develop a 21st
                  century toolkit for public problem solving, design more
                  effective skills training, and encourage institutional
                  experimentation.

                <h3>Climate Risk and the Financial System</h3>
                <p>
                  Australia can learn from a new wave of global climate policy
                  to create sustainable finance, according to a report released
                  in 2019 by MSDI. The report was co-authored by Chris Barrett,
                  Executive Director, Finance Strategy and the European Climate
                  Foundation, and Anna Skarbek, CEO of our ClimateWorks
                  Australia team. The paper surveys the policy and politics of
                  emerging international debate about climate risk for the
                  finance system. It also assesses implications for Australia
                  and frames some key questions for Australian policymakers to
                  respond to them. The paper argues that Australia has numerous
                  positive reform examples to draw on and that the ingredients
                  are there for Australia to make significant progress, and
                  quickly.

                <h3>From Townsville to Tuvalu</h3>
                <p>
                  In 2019, MSDI and Monash Medicine partnered with the Global
                  Health Alliance (GHA) to release a report on health and
                  climate change in Australia and the Asia Pacific Region. The
                  report makes an important contribution to our understanding
                  about the way in which climate change is already affecting
                  human health and on potential future impacts. It makes
                  proposals for how Australian Governments might respond to the
                  challenge, arguing that Australia’s aid, health and
                  agricultural portfolios have the opportunity to develop
                  policies that build resilience in our region to the impacts of
                  climate change on human health.

                <p>
                  MSDI’s BehaviourWorks researchers developed Australia’s first
                  social inclusion index in 2019. Commissioned as part of our
                  work with Inclusive Australia, the report holistically
                  measured Australia’s progress towards social inclusion. Our
                  research showed that nearly one in four Australians have
                  recently experienced some form of major discrimination, with
                  religious and racial minorities and Aboriginal and Torres
                  Strait Islander peoples facing the highest levels of
                  prejudice.

                <h3>Net Zero Momentum Tracker – Banking Sector Report</h3>
                <p>
                  Australian banks are taking steps towards net zero emissions
                  but actions are not yet comprehensive. Prepared by
                  ClimateWorks and MSDI, this report is part of a series
                  focusing on major sectors of the Australian Economy and part
                  of our Net Zero Momentum Tracker initiative. The report found
                  that 85 percent of banks assessed are taking steps to reduce
                  their investment and lending portfolio emissions. But it also
                  found that these commitments are not yet comprehensive or
                  fully aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement goal of net
                  zero emissions before 2050.

                <h3>Net Zero Momentum Tracker – Property Sector Report</h3>
                <p>
                  Australia’s property sector is building momentum towards net
                  zero emissions. Sector-wide adoption of a net zero ambition is
                  critical to achieving Paris-aligned targets. This report is
                  part of a series focusing on major sectors of the Australian
                  economy as part of our Net Zero Momentum Tracker initiative.
                  Examining 21 companies within Australia’s property sector, it
                  found that almost half of Australia’s largest listed property
                  companies have made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas
                  emissions that closely align with the Paris Climate Agreement.

                <h3>Natural Capital Roadmap</h3>
                <p>
                  The Natural Capital Roadmap, produced by our ClimateWorks
                  Australia team, pulls together the ideas of over 300 leaders
                  in farming, forestry, natural resource management,
                  conservation, finance, policy, research and government on how
                  to progress the natural capital agenda in Australia.
                  Mainstream economic management has developed mature systems
                  for measuring and valuing human forms of capital. Natural
                  capital thinking envisions a world where equivalent systems
                  are in place to enable more informed decisions about the
                  environment. The roadmap was developed in collaboration with
                  partners from the Queensland Government and NAB, with
                  significant contributions from workshop and summit attendees.

                <h3>Australian National Outlook</h3>
                <p>
                  The year is 2060. What does Australia look like? Have we
                  harnessed social, economic and environmental opportunities? Or
                  are we in a slow decline? This report, produced by the CSIRO
                  in partnership with the NAB, MSDI’s ClimateWorks Australia
                  team, and more than 20 other organisations, identifies the
                  challenges and opportunities we face as a nation. It signals
                  that Australia faces a slow decline if it takes no action on
                  the most significant economic, social and environmental
                  challenges. If these challenges are tackled head on, Australia
                  can look forward to a positive outlook vision, which could
                  mean higher GDP per capita, ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas
                  emissions by 2050, strong economic growth and energy
                  affordability, and more liveable major cities.

                <h3>
                  Electric Vehicle Ready Government Fleets: Increasing Update
                  and Ambition
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Transport is one of the fastest growing sources of emissions
                  in Australia. Electric vehicles fuelled by renewable energy
                  can drastically reduce the sector’s emissions. Globally, the
                  transition to electric vehicles has momentum, but Australia
                  still trails behind. Local Government fleets could help speed
                  up the transition. Based on findings from the project, our
                  ClimateWorks Australia team produced a report in 2019
                  recommending three priority areas of focus: a national
                  capacity building program to provide information and tools
                  need for transition; events to create momentum at the
                  executive level in Councils; and actions to reduce the capital
                  cost barrier to transition.
