            <h3>The SDGs need everyone</h3>
            <p>
              To achieve the SDGs, we need all sectors and actors to do their
              part and work collaboratively to tackle the world’s most pressing
              sustainable development challenges. Since 2013 MSDI, as host of
              the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Regional
              Network for Australia, New Zealand and Pacific, has been leading
              efforts to mobilise support and action towards SDG implementation
              in Australia, regionally and globally.
            </p>
            <p>
              With its core membership of knowledge institutions, and with local
              and global cross-sector collaborators, the network coordinates
              regional activities, strengthens university engagement with the
              SDGs and mobilises youth action on the SDGs. The network co-led
              the Australian SDGs Summits (2016 and 2018), has produced the
              globally-renowned guide

              and supported the global establishment of SDSN Youth, among
              leadership activities.
            </p>
            <h3>Mobilising and coordinating action</h3>
            <p>
              To highlight and strengthen the critical role that young people
              play in achieving the SDGs, this year we supported an
              <a

                >SDSN Youth Forum</a
              >
              with the Foundation for Young Australians. It brought university
              students and representatives from youth-led and youth-focused
              organisations together to discuss progress, achievements and
              future ambitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our Australian SDG Summit co-leads, the Australian Council
              for International Development, Australian Council of Social
              Service, Global Compact Network Australia and UN Association of
              Australia, we also issued a

            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, we also launched

                >Accelerating SDGs Practice</a
              >, an online series of forums to help SDSN members accelerate and
              scale up action on the SDGs within their own institutions. The
              forums, run in collaboration with Australasian Campuses Towards
              Sustainability (ACTS), covered topics such as SDG mapping,
              engaging students with the SDGs and the Times Higher Education
              Impact Rankings.

            <h3>Linking evidence to policy</h3>
            <p>
              The need for high-quality research on ‘what works’ to address
              global challenges is becoming more urgent as the 2030 deadline for
              the Sustainable Development Goals nears. However, finding credible
              research on the impact of different programs and policies can be
              challenging, especially for time-poor policymakers.

              platform is addressing this long-standing problem by providing
              free and fast access to a comprehensive repository of
              quality-appraised research reviews. We’re cataloguing the
              evidence-base on programs and policy options to help
              decision-makers decide which option is best to address Sustainable
              Development challenges in their part of the world. In 2019, MSDI
              entered into a partnership with McMaster University in Canada to
              advance this ground-breaking resource.
            </p>
            <h3>Cataloguing the research</h3>
            <p>
              MSDI has been finding, cataloguing and appraising the quality of
              research reviews relating to SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy),
              13 (Climate Action), 14 (Life Below Water) and 15 (Life on Land).
              Monash University has considerable content-area expertise in these
              SDG areas, including through our ClimateWorks Australia team. In
              2019, the Social Systems Evidence team developed a classification
              framework to enable users to easily find research on SDGs 7, 13,
              14 and 15. We added 350 records to the database using this
              framework.

              in September 2019, we also began working on rapid reviews that
              draw upon the platform to address real-world policy challenges.
              Topics include conservation management in Australia, recycling
              behaviours and business uptake of circular economy approaches (see

            <h3>Building blocks for a better world</h3>
            <p>
              To realise the sustainable development goals, and secure the
              health and wellbeing of future generations, we need leaders with
              the ability to tackle the complex global issues we face. Our most
              urgent problems – like climate change and inequality – require
              solutions that are creative, collaborative and innovative. They
              demand passionate leaders who can inspire change across multiple
              disciplines, sectors, cultures and industries. That’s why MSDI is
              helping build the capacity of people and organisations to respond
              to the world’s greatest environmental, economic and social
              challenges.

              Academia. A collaboration between the Faculties of Science and
              Arts, Monash Business School and MSDI, the Masters was recognised
              for its novel approach to interdisciplinary education. It’s an
              achievement reflected in the growing demand for the course, with
              enrolments increasing by 390% since 2017.

            <p>
              MSDI’s Leadership for Sustainable Development specialisation in
              the Masters of Environment and Sustainability continued to grow in
              2019 and play an important role in empowering our future
              sustainable development leaders. As part of the Masters, 25
              students had the opportunity to address a real-world
              sustainability challenge through our Interdisciplinary Projects
              for Sustainable Development unit. The students completed six
              projects with industry partners including Australia Post, our
              BehaviourWorks Australia team, Telstra, the Global Health
              Alliance, Corporate Citizenship, and the South East Councils
              Climate Change Alliance. The unit is a great example of the close
              collaboration between Monash and our industry partners. It
              included field trips to help students better understand local
              conditions; and students also had the opportunity to present to
              the senior management forums of our industry partners.
            </p>
            <h3>Green Steps to a better world</h3>
            <p>
              MSDI’s award-winning Green Steps program also went from strength
              to strength in 2019, achieving a record number of applications. As
              part of the application process, students took over 150 personal
              sustainability actions, which they posted on our
              <a
                href="https://www.monash.edu/sustainable-development/education/extra-curricular/take-one-step"
                target="_blank"
                >Take One Step</a
              >
              platform. Thirty emerging sustainability leaders were offered a
              place on the program and given the opportunity to undertake a
              sustainability-related consultancy project with Monash’s Buildings
              and Property Division. Students were involved in six consultancy
              projects, addressing a number of sustainability issues across the
              University. This included minimising packaging waste from
              laboratory consumables and exploring the best ways to educate and
              engage students on sustainability and the Sustainable Development
              Goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon finishing the program, over 80% of students said they were
              more likely to pursue a career related to sustainability. Now in
              its 19th year, Green Steps supports students to develop the
              skills, tools and knowledge they need to become effective global
              leaders.

            <h3>Fostering business leaders of the future</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019, MSDI’s Education team offered three units in partnership
              with the Monash Business School.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We launched a new core unit as part of the Master of Global
                Business and Master of Management, which scored very highly in
                overall student satisfaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sustainability in a Global World was offered as a two-day
                seminar to 44 participants as part of the Masters of Business
                Administration.
              </li>
              <li>
                We also offered a final year capstone unit Sustainability
                Practice and Organisations. Over 120 students from diverse
                international backgrounds completed the unit, with one student
                saying it had changed the way they thought about business and
                what its aim should be.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Building capacity in climate change and health</h3>
            <p>
              Our Education team also collaborated on research with the Faculty
              of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences to build capacity for the
              health profession to teach students about the links between
              health, and climate change and environmental sustainability

            <h3>Professional and Continuing Education</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019 MSDI continued to bring the latest sustainable development
              and behaviour change thinking into the workplace with customised
              skills development, capacity building and executive training.
            </p>
            <h3>Bringing behavioural science into the workplace</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019, our BehaviourWorks Australia team engaged with 1160
              people at 20 organisations, running 77 training and education
              sessions across the country. They ran behaviour change courses for
              the Australia and New Zealand School of Government in Brisbane,
              Hobart, and Wellington. Our team continued working with the
              Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet to deliver training
              sessions to members of the Victorian public service, introducing
              behaviour change methods, how to design interventions, working up
              their own projects in the Behaviour Change Project Lab, and
              running randomised control trials. The team partnered with NSW
              Environment Protection Authority (EPA) to develop a 12-week
              practical, applied, project-based ‘Behaviour Change Bootcamp’
              which has generated significant interest and excellent results.
              The team also designed and delivered a responsive, highly tailored
              curriculum of just-in-time training to support development of a
              new behavioural insights team at QBE Insurance. The training
              supported the team across the full project life cycle to design,
              implement and assess field trials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Training for the BehaviourWorks Australia Consortium partners
              included masterclasses, specialist sessions around the INSPIRE
              tool for improving written communication and a new fully online
              behaviour change foundation course.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Helping businesses deal with climate change and business risk
            </h3>
            <p>
              In 2019 MSDI’s Education and ClimateWorks Australia teams
              collaborated on a Climate Change and Business Risk course for
              professionals and executives. Delivered for the first time in
              2019, the course supported business leaders to assess the risks
              and opportunities arising from climate change and to apply these
              to their own company strategies. The training featured eminent
              guest presenters from industry, including from BHP, APRA, Westpac,
              IFM Investors and Minter Ellison. A total of 38 business leaders
              attended from across banking, investment, insurance, mining,
              retail, water, and engineering. As a result of the training, our
              experts also produced tailored workshops for senior company
              managers to inform climate strategy development.
            </p>
            <p>
              MSDI also launched its

                >Public Purpose Leadership</a
              >
              program in December 2019. The program builds on the legacy of the
              Centre for Sustainability Leadership Future Makers program, which
              was passed to MSDI when the Centre closed its operations. The
              program has been postponed due to COVID-19, but will be
              re-scheduled once restrictions have eased.

                >Leave No One Behind</a
              >
              is one of the largest university social entrepreneurship programs
              in Australia. Led by MSDI and run in collaboration with the
              Faculties of Arts, Law, Education, Business, and Art, Design and
              Architecture, the program gives Monash students the opportunity to
              address social inclusion challenges in the community by developing
              social business ideas. The program is also building critical
              skills, behaviours and mindsets needed for entrepreneurship and
              social impact. Over 10 weeks, students work in interdisciplinary
              teams to develop, test and pitch new business ideas. Winners are
              awarded seed funding and in-kind support to help get their
              businesses off the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leave No One Behind has generated many powerful ideas over the
              past three years and alumni have gone on to access other
              entrepreneurship opportunities at Monash and beyond, building a
              pipeline of future leaders and innovators.
            </p>
            <h3>Creating future innovators and entrepreneurs</h3>
            <p>
              Leave No One Behind kicks off with a Social Innovation Summit, an
              inspiring day where students learn about the Sustainable
              Development Goals and hear from social entrepreneurs making a
              difference. In 2019, 250 students attended, with 100 offered a
              place in the program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Seven teams consisting of 32 students then worked to develop, test

              included Aunty, a social enterprise that makes and home-delivers
              spice kits, and donates proceeds to service providers supporting
              and empowering migrant women. Slumber was another winner,
              producing an aromatic pillow spray that creates a sleep-inducing
              environment. Profits from this go towards helping rough sleepers
              in Victoria.

            <h3>Translating insights into practice</h3>
            <p>
              Just a decade ago, the ‘behavioural sciences’ were viewed as a
              disparate mix of social science disciplines. Today, specialised
              behaviour change units are an integrated function of many
              government agencies. This rapid expansion has led to strong demand
              for PhD qualified behavioural experts capable of straddling the
              worlds of academia and industry. It’s a gap that MSDI has sought
              to fill by establishing the first-ever

              program. The program utilises our BehaviourWorks Australia team’s
              world-recognised expertise in solving real-world problems and
              working with government and industry to translate behavioural
              insights into policy and practice.
            </p>
            <h3>Monash’s first behaviour change GRIP</h3>
            <p>
              Eight industry partners are now working with 17 talented PhD
              candidates on a series of common and complex policy problems. This
              includes domestic violence, plastics use, energy performance,
              environmental and ecosystems management, road safety, mental
              health, social inclusion and healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working together as a cohort, and with the support of supervisors
              from six Monash University faculties and institutes, in 2019 the
              candidates gained a strong grounding in behavioural theory and
              practice. They were guided through a professional development
              program and completed a series of industry placements to learn
              about their respective partners’ strategic priorities. The
              candidates also successfully achieved their key milestones and
              gained confidence presenting at, and participating in, various
              formal and informal events, including the 3 Minute Thesis
              competition, ‘Nudgeathons’ and scientific meetings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many students also began to find their voice, penning articles for
              The Conversation and other media outlets and accepting invitations
              to participate in local and international workshops. The combined
              efforts, outputs and achievements of the students were shared at a
              dedicated GRIP Showcase in December 2019.

            <h3>Innovating in the public sector</h3>
            <p>
              Governments of all political stripes are being buffeted by
              technological and societal change. As public problems become more
              complex, governments are struggling to tackle them effectively and
              legitimately. To do so, the public sector needs to embrace new
              problem-solving tools and rethink processes that inhibit
              innovation. But do Australian public servants have the
              capabilities needed to solve public problems? And are public
              sector leaders enabling or disabling this? In 2019, we set out to
              answer this question.
            </p>
            <h3>Fostering a new generation of public problem solvers</h3>
            <p>
              In collaboration with the Governance Lab at New York University,
              and funded by the Australian and New Zealand School of Government
              (ANZSOG), we surveyed over 400 Australian and New Zealand public
              servants in a pioneering study. We asked policy practitioners
              about their awareness, competency and use of a range of new
              innovation methods. While all of these methods are being used well
              somewhere in government, and people are eager to embrace them,
              training is not prioritised by government agencies. We published
              our findings in a landmark report entitled:
              <a
                href="https://www.anzsog.edu.au/resource-library/news-media/todays-problems-yesterdays-toolkit-public-service"
                target="_blank"
                >‘Today’s Problems, Yesterday’s Toolkit’</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              The report outlines why public problem solving is so urgent at
              this moment in history and pinpoints the new skills that ‘public
              entrepreneurs’ need. This includes systems thinking, data
              analytics and behaviour change. We studied effective public sector
              training programs around the world and identified key features to
              inform future course development. The report was widely promoted
              in the media and public service, and was ANZSOG’s most downloaded
              report for the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              MSDI is now extending its partnership with ANZSOG and The GovLab
              to design and develop an online course which will help public
              servants use new innovation methods to solve complex public
              problems. We’re also advising government agencies on these methods
              for public problem solving. And we’ll be supporting government
              agencies to identify their capability gaps and co-designing
              training programs to address them.

            <h3>Enhancing the effectiveness of our political leadership</h3>
            <p>
              Politicians operate in an increasingly complex environment, yet
              politics is one of few vocations without structured professional
              development. The McKinnon Institute is a new organisation
              dedicated to providing professional development programs for state
              and federal politicians. Non-partisan and not-for-profit, the
              Institute was established in June 2019 through a partnership
              between Monash University and the Susan McKinnon Foundation. The
              Institute sits within the portfolio of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor
              for Education, Professor Susan Elliott and has significant input
              from MSDI. The Institute is committed to raising the standard of
              political leadership by offering professional development for
              current and aspiring politicians. It will also work to widen the
              pool of talented people who would consider a career in politics
              and build their capability, confidence and impact.
            </p>
            <h3>Relationship building and course development</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019 MSDI worked with Monash External Relations Development and
              Alumni to formalise a partnership between Monash University and
              the Susan McKinnon Foundation. MSDI then worked with the DVC
              (Education) to support the Board in developing strategy and
              governance, liaising with senior stakeholders and driving course
              development. The team reviewed global best practice in leadership
              development and conducted extensive stakeholder-based research to
              inform course development. Interviews, focus groups and surveys
              were conducted with a variety of stakeholders, including state and
              federal MPs, to gain an understanding of their needs and
              interests. Strong relationships were established with the Speaker
              of the Federal Parliament and Speakers and Presidents of some
              state Parliaments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Institute is now in the process of developing and delivering a
              range of programs, including broad-based training for current
              politicians and a more selective program to develop advanced
              leadership capabilities. The McKinnon Institute for Political
              Leadership benefits from the strong partnership MSDI enjoys with
              the Monash Professional and Continuing Education (PACE) team.
