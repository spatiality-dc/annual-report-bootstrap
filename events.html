                <h3>Pacific Urban Forum, Fiji</h3>
                <p>
                  MSDI, through the RISE program, was a co-sponsor for this
                  year's Pacific Urban Forum, held in Nadi, Fiji in July 2019.
                  Held every four years, the Pacific Urban Forum is the premier
                  regional event bringing together government representatives
                  and urban development stakeholders to engage in policy
                  dialogue towards a sustainable urban future for the Pacific.
                  Over 25 countries participated in the 2019 event with the
                  theme ‘Accelerating implementation of the New Urban Agenda to
                  achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in the Pacific’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  MSDI’s Matthew French, RISE Program Manager, and Amalie Wright
                  from RISE's Design and Engagement team showcased how RISE
                  places evidence at the heart of a revitalisation program's
                  efforts, discussing why better evidence is needed of what
                  works in terms of delivering sustainable, cost-effective
                  health and environmental improvements. MSDI’s Julie Boulton
                  was the focal point for the academia stakeholder group at the
                  Forum. The closing of the forum saw Pacific Island Countries
                  come together to endorse a collective Declaration, outlining
                  the direction and actions that their governments will take to
                  ensure that Pacific urban areas are ‘prosperous, inclusive,
                  safe, resilient and sustainable’.

                <p>
                  Six MSDI staff and eight Monash students converged on New York
                  in late September to participate in a number of events
                  including the International Conference on Sustainable
                  Development (ICSD), the Sustainable Development Solutions
                  Network (SDSN) meetings, Climate Week, and to promote the new
                  MSDI/McMaster Social Systems Evidence initiative (SSE). This
                  year’s activities in New York also included the first

                  to review progress on the SDGs since they were adopted in
                  2015.

                <p>
                  Two MSDI staff and two student delegates presented papers, and
                  six students presented posters as part of the ICSD. In her
                  role as SDSN Network Manager, MSDI’s Dr Tahl Kestin co-chaired
                  two sessions at the conference on Transforming the Higher
                  Education System to Accelerate SDG Implementation. MSDI’s
                  Chair, Professor John Thwaites, hosted a panel session on the
                  challenges of translating research evidence into public policy
                  and strategies to address barriers to translation around the
                  world.

                  SDSN AusNZPacific and SDSN Canada co-hosted a workshop to
                  introduce the Social Systems Evidence platform to key
                  international stakeholders and seek feedback on how we could
                  best connect the platform to policymakers and others vested in
                  advancing the SDGs. The team also presented to the SDSN
                  Leadership Council as part of a session examining the role of
                  data and evidence in achieving the SDGs. Anna Skarbek, CEO of
                  MSDI’s ClimateWorks Australia team, attended a number of
                  events as part of Climate Week including a World Green

                <p>
                  Monash University became an official Observer Organisation of
                  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in
                  2016 and has since sent annual delegations to their Conference

                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2019, a delegation of 16 staff and students attended the
                  2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) in
                  Madrid in December.

                  >, which included specialists in environmental law, energy
                  transitions and climate change communication, came from
                  several of the university's leading centres and institutes
                  including the

                  >
                  and MSDI.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Monash delegates were invited to speak at a wide range of
                  events including press conferences, panel discussions and side
                  events.
                </p>

                <p>
                  MSDI’s ClimateWorks’ team spoke at SDSN’s Low Emissions
                  Solutions Conference with Professor Jeffrey Sachs where the
                  importance of Southeast Asian countries joining the green race
                  was discussed, and ClimateWorks research on how Southeast
                  Asian countries can build a comparative advantage in low
                  carbon technologies was presented.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The team also participated in official side events with the
                  UNFCCC Secretariat. A global group of university students,
                  including Monash student delegates, partnered together to
                  facilitate over 10 side events and press conferences on
                  student research linked to the SDGs. Other events included
                  "Enhancing Ambition through International Instruments &
                  Innovations from the Paris Agreement & Beyond" and “A Roadmap
                  on the future: Identifying next steps and integrating
                  practical approaches to good governance in implementing the
                  Katowice Climate Package”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Monash students also met with Australian government
                  representatives, Global Voices, and youth from across
                  Australia (including secondary school students), to give a
                  student perspective on youth representation at COP and
                  recommend ways in which the government could engage with youth
                  delegates at COP26.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Monash’s involvement and visibility at the event was maximised
                  through an excellent collaboration between MSDI and Monash
                  Global Engagement who coordinated the delegation.

                <p>
                  In March, ClimateWorks Australia hosted Dr Ben Caldecott,
                  Founding Director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme
                  at the University of Oxford. In his conversation with
                  ClimateWorks Australia’s CEO Anna Skarbek, Dr Caldecott
                  discussed the role of finance in limiting climate change to
                  well below 2 degrees, the challenges of climate change for
                  investors, and the financial system more broadly, including
                  the potential for significant asset stranding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dr Caldecott’s work in developing new tools to support
                  investor influence on companies and their environmental
                  footprints was also explored and drew on his publications on
                  Carbon Lock-In Curves and on the findings of the 7th
                  Sustainable Finance Forum.

                <h3>Green Chemistry with Professor John Warner</h3>
                <p>
                  In August, MSDI hosted a seminar by Professor John Warner,
                  President and Chief Technology Officer at the Warner Babcock
                  Institute and Adjunct Professor in the School of Chemistry at
                  Monash. Recently named one of ‘25 Visionaries Changing the
                  World’, Professor Warner is the recipient of the 2014 Perkin
                  Medal - the highest honour in American industrial chemistry.
                  He is best known as one of the founders of the field of Green
                  Chemistry - a form of chemistry which seeks to design
                  materials and products that limit the impact on human health
                  and the environment while still being economically
                  competitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In his lecture, John presented the history of Green Chemistry,
                  challenged the fundamentals of how chemistry is being taught
                  and encouraged us all to think about how products are made to
                  create a safer and more sustainable future.

                <h3>Law Needs Feminism Because…</h3>
                <p>
                  In September, Associate Professor Becky Batagol teamed up with
                  Monash Law student Maria Pirozek to bring the hugely
                  successful "Law Needs Feminism Because" project to Australia
                  to put a spotlight on gender inequality in the legal
                  profession.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Australian exhibition, which ran until December, helped
                  shine a light on Sustainable Development Goals 5 (Gender
                  Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and was held at Monash
                  University's Law Library at Clayton. Originally a
                  Canadian-based photography project, “Law Needs Feminism
                  Because” had spread across 18 Canadian universities but the
                  Australian exhibition marked the first time the project had
                  been launched outside of North America.

                <p>
                  The landmark report “From Townsville to Tuvalu - Health and
                  Climate Change in Australia and the Asia Pacific Region”
                  produced by The Global Health Alliance with MSDI and the
                  Monash School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine was
                  launched in Melbourne in July 2019 with high level

                  The latest science tells us that climate change will have a
                  big impact on human health – from childhood obesity, heart
                  failure and diabetes, to stunting, increases in allergies,
                  asthma attacks and waterborne diseases. The launch event
                  brought together experts from Monash and the Doherty Institute
                  for Infection and Immunity to discuss those impacts and
                  explore how we might reduce them in both Australia and the
                  Indo-Pacific region.

                  Glover (MSDI) and Beth Noveck (GovLab), presented findings of
                  their report to policymakers and stakeholders, and spoke of
                  the decline in public trust in governments and the need to
                  develop new ways of working. They also called for the
                  development of a 21st century toolkit for public problem
                  solving, designing more effective skills training and
                  encouraging institutional experimentation.

                <p>
                  The Inclusive Australia Social Inclusion Index, a report
                  developed by MSDI’s BehaviourWorks Australia team, was
                  launched in December to support and coincide with the launch
                  of the organisation Inclusive Australia (IA), which seeks to
                  reduce the negative impacts of exclusion. The official launch
                  event was held in Canberra with additional events held in
                  Melbourne and Sydney.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Melbourne event, MC'd by Helen Kapalos - Journalist and TV
                  presenter, was held at MSDI’s city hub with the event reaching
                  capacity and fostering excellent dialogue between
                  stakeholders. The keynote address at the Melbourne event was
                  delivered by Professor Sue Elliot, Deputy Vice-Chancellor at
                  Monash University. Professor Elliot emphasised that if we want
                  to tackle social inclusion, it is vital that stakeholders have
                  the tools they need to make change happen and to improve how
                  Australians view and appreciate the differences in others.
