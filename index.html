            <h3>Accelerating global action</h3>
            <p>
              Over half of Australia’s land is utilised by agriculture, which
              contributes significantly to the economy. However, agriculture,
              forestry and other land uses are responsible for around 12% of
              Australia’s emissions, and over half of Australia’s water
              consumption. With global population increasing, the world will
              need to feed another three billion people by 2050. Without
              significant shifts in consumption patterns, enormous pressure will
              be placed on land and oceans – which are already in decline.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Australia to maintain a competitive food and land use sector,
              meet the needs of future generations and realise economic
              opportunities, agriculture needs to become more sustainable and
              resilient. To achieve this, the Land Use Futures program is
              working with the international Food and Land Use Coalition, a
              global effort to accelerate action towards sustainable food and
              land use systems by 2050.
            </p>
            <h3>Partnering for impact</h3>
            <p>
              In partnership with Deakin University and CSIRO, the Land Use
              Futures program aims to support the transition to a sustainable
              food and land use system in Australia. The program takes a
              participatory approach to problem solving, inviting leaders from
              the private sector, government, research and community to
              co-create pathways for a range of possible solutions across
              dietary shifts, conservation, waste, circular economy and food
              innovation. These solutions could deliver improvements for the
              climate, environment, livelihoods, food security and nutrition.
              The program aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals,
              particularly Goal #2: Zero hunger.
            </p>
            <h3>Natural Capital Summit and Roadmap</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019, the Land Use Futures team ran workshops around Australia,
              to understand the challenges the sector faces. With the support of
              the Queensland Government and NAB, the team delivered the Natural
              Capital Summit in Brisbane, where 150 stakeholders were engaged in
              further discussions. From this, they identified the need for an
              evidence-based, practical framework for linking financial outcomes
              and land management practices.

            <h3>Accelerating global action</h3>
            <p>
              Over half of Australia’s land is utilised by agriculture, which
              contributes significantly to the economy. However, agriculture,
              forestry and other land uses are responsible for around 12% of
              Australia’s emissions, and over half of Australia’s water
              consumption. With global population increasing, the world will
              need to feed another three billion people by 2050. Without
              significant shifts in consumption patterns, enormous pressure will
              be placed on land and oceans – which are already in decline.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Australia to maintain a competitive food and land use sector,
              meet the needs of future generations and realise economic
              opportunities, agriculture needs to become more sustainable and
              resilient. To achieve this, the Land Use Futures program is
              working with the international Food and Land Use Coalition, a
              global effort to accelerate action towards sustainable food and
              land use systems by 2050.
            </p>
            <h3>Partnering for impact</h3>
            <p>
              In partnership with Deakin University and CSIRO, the Land Use
              Futures program aims to support the transition to a sustainable
              food and land use system in Australia. The program takes a
              participatory approach to problem solving, inviting leaders from
              the private sector, government, research and community to
              co-create pathways for a range of possible solutions across
              dietary shifts, conservation, waste, circular economy and food
              innovation. These solutions could deliver improvements for the
              climate, environment, livelihoods, food security and nutrition.
              The program aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals,
              particularly Goal #2: Zero hunger.

            <h3>Natural Capital Summit and Roadmap</h3>
            <p>
              In 2019, the Land Use Futures team ran workshops around Australia,
              to understand the challenges the sector faces. With the support of
              the Queensland Government and NAB, the team delivered the Natural
              Capital Summit in Brisbane, where 150 stakeholders were engaged in
              further discussions. From this, they identified the need for an
              evidence-based, practical framework for linking financial outcomes
              and land management practices.
