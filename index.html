              <h3>Accelerating global action</h3>
              <p>
                Over half of Australia’s land is utilised by agriculture, which
                contributes significantly to the economy. However, agriculture,
                forestry and other land uses are responsible for around 12% of
                Australia’s emissions, and over half of Australia’s water consumption.
                With global population increasing, the world will need to feed another
                three billion people by 2050. Without significant shifts in
                consumption patterns, enormous pressure will be placed on land and
                oceans – which are already in decline.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Australia to maintain a competitive food and land use sector, meet
                the needs of future generations and realise economic opportunities,
                agriculture needs to become more sustainable and resilient. To achieve
                this, the Land Use Futures program is working with the international
                Food and Land Use Coalition, a global effort to accelerate action
                towards sustainable food and land use systems by 2050.
              </p>
              <h3>Partnering for impact</h3>
              <p>
                In partnership with Deakin University and CSIRO, the Land Use Futures
                program aims to support the transition to a sustainable food and land
                use system in Australia. The program takes a participatory approach to
                problem solving, inviting leaders from the private sector, government,
                research and community to co-create pathways for a range of possible
                solutions across dietary shifts, conservation, waste, circular economy
                and food innovation. These solutions could deliver improvements for
                the climate, environment, livelihoods, food security and nutrition.
                The program aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals,
                particularly Goal #2: Zero hunger.
              </p>
              <h3>Natural Capital Summit and Roadmap</h3>
              <p>
                In 2019, the Land Use Futures team ran workshops around Australia, to
                understand the challenges the sector faces. With the support of the
                Queensland Government and NAB, the team delivered the Natural Capital
                Summit in Brisbane, where 150 stakeholders were engaged in further
                discussions. From this, they identified the need for an
                evidence-based, practical framework for linking financial outcomes and
                land management practices.
              </p>

                Our
                <a href="https://www.climateworksaustralia.org/">ClimateWorks</a> team

                >, which outlines action areas for improving the measurement and
                valuation of natural capital in Australia. In 2020, the Land Use
                Futures program also contributed to the Food, Agriculture,
                Biodiversity, Land-use and Energy Consortium report, Pathways to
                Sustainable Land-Use and Food Systems. The team also launched the
                Natural Capital Investment Initiative in partnership with NAB, to help
                farmers in adopting sustainable and profitable land management
                practices.

              <h3>Capturing the commitments</h3>
              <p>
                As the climate heats up, many Australian businesses are committing to helping Australia lower its emissions, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. But how do we know what these commitments are? 
              </p>
              <p>
                This year, led by our <a href="https://www.climateworksaustralia.org/">ClimateWorks Australia</a> team, we developed the Net Zero Momentum Tracker, which gathers Australian emissions reduction commitments together in one place. Our tracker captures the depth of commitments made, from general commitments to net zero pledges, to increase transparency around corporate climate action. The project also provides opportunities for our team to engage with sector leaders to understand the challenges they face and how our research can support decision-making.
              </p>
              <h3>Tracking the property sector</h3>
              <p>
                Given how influential the property sector is in terms of energy use and emissions, our first report released in 2019 examined the commitments made by 21 property companies (those listed in the ASX200 and those with the highest reported emissions). We found that 43 percent of these companies had a target, aspiration, or are on a path closely aligned with net zero by or before 2050. 47.5 percent of companies were taking steps to reduce emissions. Two companies had no apparent emissions reduction commitments or activities.
              </p>
              <h3>Tracking the banking sector</h3>
              <p>
                In November 2019, our second report found that 25 percent of the 20 banks assessed were preparing to target net zero emissions by or before 2050 for their investment and lending portfolios. A further 65 percent were fully aligned or on a pathway to net zero by or before 2050 for their operations, which includes energy use in offices and branches. The team has also published reports in 2020 assessing net zero commitments in the retail and local government sectors.

              <h3>Creating system transformation</h3>
              <p>
                Building on a decade’s worth of work to achieve a sustainable, low-emissions future, MSDI’s ClimateWorks Australia team is collaborating with government and sector leaders to create the system transformations required to bring emissions from Australia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific in line with global climate targets. We’re also assisting decision-makers across the region to identify low-carbon forms of economic growth.
              </p>
              <h3>Developing leadership</h3>
              <p>
                In 2019 MSDI, together with our ClimateWorks team, delivered our first executive education programme: Climate Change and Business Risk: Developing a Strategic Approach. The course educates business leaders in identifying climate change risks and opportunities, developing and climate scenarios and applying this understanding to company strategy.
              </p>
              <h3>Creating a vision for the future </h3>
              <p>
                In 2019, our team also worked with CSIRO on the question: What will Australia look like economically, socially and environmentally by 2060? The outcome of this investigation is the Australian National Outlook 2019, a comprehensive body of work that identifies our most significant economic, social and environmental challenges across five key areas: industry, cities, energy production, agriculture and corporate culture. The report warns of a slow decline if no action is taken. However, it paints a bright future if challenges are addressed early.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Climate-KIC, our ClimateWorks team also jointly hosted ‘Unlocking Australia’s Sustainable Finance’, involving practitioners from the European Union’s High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance. In addition, the team also partnered with Vivid Economics to consider how Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam can take advantage of growing low-carbon markets.

              <h3>Gaining a better understanding</h3>
              <p>
                Victorians Value Nature (VVN) is a program run by the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) as a key plank of the Victorian Government’s Biodiversity 2037 plan. It aims to raise awareness of biodiversity and facilitate occasions for people to connect with, and act for, nature. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Many Victorians already connect with nature in their daily lives and these behaviours can easily be incorporated into programs such as VNN.  To gain a better understanding of how Victorians connect with nature day-to-day, our BehaviourWorks Australia team collaborated with DEWLP in 2019 on the design and implementation of a foundational survey with 3,000 Victorians.

              <h3>We uncovered a deep connection to nature</h3>
              <p>
                Our survey revealed that 95 percent of Victorians are aware of the condition of Victoria’s environment and the importance of biodiversity. Some 86 percent have pro-environmental and pro-social values. Over 60 percent feel connected, or very connected, to nature, and 32 percent spend time in nature every day or every other day. The top three places where Victorians felt most connected included national parks, beaches and their own gardens. In fact, 42 percent told us they frequently spend time in their garden. But we also found some common barriers, including not having enough time, having family and friends who don’t enjoy spending time in nature and gaining access.

              <h3>Developing a new plan </h3>
              <p>
                The findings of the Victorians Value Nature survey are now being considered by DEWLP to help increase opportunities for Victorians to connect with nature. This includes through their own gardens and by performing small acts, such as planting native species, participating in citizen science and picking up litter on the beach.
